# 📚 Advanced Data Structures in C (ADS)

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **C programs** implementing various **data structures and algorithms**, created as part of my academic practice and learning in **Advanced Data Structures (ADS)**.

Each `.c` file demonstrates a specific data structure, algorithm, or problem-solving technique commonly used in computer science.
